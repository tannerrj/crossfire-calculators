# Crossfire Calculators

This project includes various calculators for the MRPG game of Crossfire.

The calculators are HTML and javascript based pages to perform functions such as:

 * Money or currency conversions (i.e., gold to silver coins)
 * Party Experience - how much experience does a monster need to have for all members in a party to gain experience for vanquishing that foe(s)

### Requirements

A web browser with javascript enabled.

## Usage

The web pages are self contained in that the necessary html elements and javascript are all within the one web page file, so open the file in a browser and it should work.
